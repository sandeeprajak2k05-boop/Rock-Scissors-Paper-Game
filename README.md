# Rock-Scissors-Paper-Game
Developed a Rock–Scissors–Paper game that allows a user to play against the computer. The game uses basic programming logic to accept user input, generate random computer choices, compare results based on predefined rules, and display the winner. The project focuses on strengthening problem-solving skills, control structures, and logical thinking.
